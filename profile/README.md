# 🧰 Automation Tools Overview

This document provides a short, centralized overview of all internal automation tools available in this organization.

All tools are accessed through a single **Dashboard application**, which displays every tool as a button and handles launching them correctly.

## 🧭 Dashboard (Central Launcher)

Purpose  
The dashboard is the main entry point for all automation tools.

What it does
- 📋 Shows all tools in one place
- 🖱️ Opens tools using buttons
- 📂 Ensures correct paths and shared data usage
- 🚫 Removes the need for command-line execution

Important
- ✅ Always start tools from the dashboard
- ⚠️ Tools should not be launched directly unless for development

## 🖥️ Dashboard Executable (Dashboard.exe)

The dashboard can also be used as a Windows executable file to simplify usage and remove the need to manually run Python files.

What the executable provides
- 🚀 One-click startup using Dashboard.exe
- 🧑‍💻 No command-line interaction required
- 🔁 Same behavior as dashboard.pyw
- 🔍 Automatic detection of all available tools

How to use the executable
1. 📁 Place Dashboard.exe inside the **dashboard** folder
2. 📁 Ensure all tool folders are located in the same parent directory as the **dashboard** folder
3. 🖱️ Double-click Dashboard.exe to launch the dashboard
4. 🎯 Select the required tool by clicking its button
5. 📌 Follow on-screen instructions if shown
